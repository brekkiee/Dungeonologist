No, it’s the chase that excites them. They’ll stalk their prey for hours, watching, waiting, learning. I suspect they enjoy it more than the actual kill. But here’s the thing—they don’t always hunt alone."},

Throw another carnivore in their enclosure and watch. The Imp will either outwit its new friend or end up as dinner. Nature at its finest, wouldn’t you agree?"},
